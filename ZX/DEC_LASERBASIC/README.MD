In 1994 Eugeniy Mikhailov (HVG) made big work in decompilation of  Laser Basic (nice graphics library developed by Oasis Software in 1986) to get its assembler representation which could be linked to applications as external library. There is some documentation but only in Russian. I have converted assembler files from GENS format to ASM80 format and text files to UTF8.   
* V1 - version 1.00 (version of 1994)
* V3 - version 3.17 (version of 1997)

I successfully played with the  library in game development for ZX-Spectrum in 90th.
